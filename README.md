# Auto Classroom Attendance
This application is setup on a webserver. Use a device to browse to the student_sign_in.php to automatically scan students' ID card using a generic bar code scanner and output the correct attendance status of each student in the class.

Please be kind.  I am very much a noob and this is my first project.  I am working on this project to help alleviate some of the tasks I have at the beginning of class, and I HATE taking attendance.
